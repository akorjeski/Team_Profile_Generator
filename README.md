# Homework 10: Team Profile Generator
## Deployed Application: https://akorjeski.github.io/Team_Profile_Generator/
## Github Repository:   https://github.com/akorjeski/Team_Profile_Generator
## Technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, node.js, NPM, jest

## User Story:
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles

## The purpose of this application is to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, this will also be ensuring that all unit tests pass.

The project will prompt the user to build an engineering team. An engineering
team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns.

The project will generate a `team.html` page in the `output` directory, that displays a nicely formatted team roster. Each team member will display the following:

  * Name

  * Role

  * ID

  * Role-specific property (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)


### The application will be invoked with the following command:  	__node app.js__  

### Before you get started, make sure you run __npm install__ to make sure you install all the needed dependencies.  

### Tests can be run with: __npm run test__
